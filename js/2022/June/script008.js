/* QUESTION:
An ATM machine is loaded with 3 notes: $100, $50, and $20. 
Write a function that returns an array of numbers, representing the number of each note denomination to be dispensed by the ATM machine when a customer tries to withdraw money.

Example One:
Amount = $150
Function return: [1, 1, 0]
Explanation: This implies that $100 = 1, $50 = 1, $20 = 0

Example Two:
Amount = $230
Function return: [1, 1, 4]
Explanation: This implies that $100 = 1, $50 = 1, $20 = 4

Note that in each case, the function should return based on the minimum number of notes to be dispensed.
