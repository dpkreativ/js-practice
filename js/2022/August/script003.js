/**
 * Given an arr[] of size N, containing elements from 1 to N
 * Find the position after K jumps from index 1, where the jump from the ith index
 * sends to arr[i]
 */

/**
 * Explanation:
 * Assuming you have an array like:
 *
 * size = 6
 * arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 *
 * If you're making three jumps:
 * K = 3
 *
 * First Jump:
 * START FROM arr[0] which has a value of 1
 * LAND IN arr[1] which has a value of 2
 *
 * Second Jump:
 * START FROM arr[2] which has a value of 3
 * LAND IN arr[4] which has a value of 5
 *
 * START FROM arr[5] which has a value of 6
 *
 * Omoh na to Google the correct challenge oh.
 *
 * Anyway to solve this:
 *
 * while / for => K times
 *
